Welcome to GameofSource Web Development Arena. 

<h4>About Event</h4>
Game of Source is a Open-Source Contribution event being organized by GeeksForGeeks and its student chapters across PAN India. 
The event is going to witness the participation from students of over 100+ colleges in various cities and will provide a plethora of opportunities to budding developers to directly learn from the domain experts and try their hands on practical execution of events in this celebration of learning.

<h4>What participants must do</h4>
Participants will be given an issue as a feature to develop in the web development template. Issues will be opened in github repository at a time specified earlier in the whatsapp group. Once going through the issues published participants must request the issue to be assigned to them. We check the participants github when there are many  requests and assign an issue to a <b>single</b> participant only. Once assigned participants must solve that issue within 48 hours and make a pull request to repository from the branch. Our repo maintainers will go through the pull request thoroughly and can merge once satisfied all the rules mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/GameofSource-GFG/Web-Development/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> file. If participant is failed to make pull request and didn't show any prorgress on that issue within 24 hours, the issue will be cancelled and we assign that issue to another participant.
